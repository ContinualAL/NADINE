Instruction Manual:

Please extract the file zip file and open the folder.
For the classification problem:
1. Open the main Matlab running file (RunNADINEClassification.m) under the folder.
2. Run this file. It will load a dataset depending on the index you set in the RunNADINEClassification.m. 
3. The index i represents how many times/rounds we want to run the algorithm, whereas index j represents how do we select the dataset.
4. Assuming that we have dataset ready in the matlab path, we can run the algorithm. Otherwise, download The dataset at the link below:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nbbiNAa6ZHIL9orNjQCQXuqyEXZ3bCdI?usp=sharing. For the classification problem, dataset is stored
under the Classification folder.
5. The 'results' folder is a reserved folder to save all the files (IT SHOULD BE CREATED) that are generated when we run NADINE algorithm.
Below is the example of generated files under the results folder: 
- 4RFIDresults.mat and 4RFIDresults.fig represent the numerical result and the figure of NADINE's performance in processing the RFID dataset in the 4th round.


For the regression problem:
1. Open the main Matlab running file (RunNADINERegression.m) under the folder.
2. It will call the matlab NADINE_regression.m
3. In regression problem, the dataset also can be downloaded in the link above under the Regression folder
4. The rest of the steps are similar with the classification problems
